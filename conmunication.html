<ul><li>	Common ground
</li><li>	Joint Action
</li><li>	Features of Face to Face communication
</li><li>	Process of Grounding
</li><li>	Levels of Joint Action
</li><li>	Tracks and Layers

<p>Key aspects of Communication</p>
<ul><li>	Communication is a collaborative activity
</li><li>	Communication requires common ground
</li><li>	Communication is essential for joint action
</li><li>	Different media provide different “constraints on grounding”
</li></ul>


<p><b>What is Common Ground?</b></p>
<p>Something that people all know each other knows. </p>
<p><i>“a proposition p is only common ground if: all the people conversing know p; and they know that they all know p”</i></p>

<p>ex. Text on a graph explaining what things are.</p>
<ul><li>	Common language (e.g., English)
</li><li>	Common capabilities (e.g., sight, hearing)
</li><li>	Common reference (e.g., visual material)
</li><li>	Common knowledge (e.g., domain knowledge, common sense)
</li><li>	Common vocabulary (e.g., technical vs. lay terms)
</li><li>	Protocol (e.g., professional etiquette)
</li><li>	Culture (comes with assumptions about knowledge, protocol)
</li><li>	History (recent and distant)
</li></ul>

<p>ex. Menu of a new pages</p>


<h2 id="Interpreting Language">Interpreting Language</h2>
<p> Face to face is a joint action. </p>
<ul><li>	It’s “basic” that don’t need to lean
<ul><li>		Precedes written communication
</li></ul></li><li>	It’s not just verbal
<ul><li>		Gesture, facial expression and grunts
</li></ul></li><li>	It’s a joint action, two people have to do it together
</li><li>	F2F uses common ground to make communication efficient
</li><li>	F2F conversation develops common ground
</li></ul>


<ul><li>	k is a joint action engaged by A and B if…
<ul><li>		A believes k includes A’s part plus B’s part
</li><li>		A intends to do A’s part
</li><li>		B believes k includes A’s part plus B’s part
</li><li>		B believes A intends to do A’s part
</li><li>		A believes B believes A intends to do A’s part
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Constraints on Grounding</b></p>
<ul><li>	Copresence: A and B in same physical environment (colocation)
</li><li>	Visibility: A and B are visible to one another
</li><li>	Audibility: A and B communicate by speaking, noise
</li><li>	Contemporality: B receives at roughly the same time as A produces
</li><li>	Simultaneity: A and B can send/receive simultaneously (e.g., nodding)
</li><li>	Sequentiality: A’s and B’s turns cannot get out of sequence (e.g., emails out of order ~= sequential)
</li><li>	Reviewability: B can review A’s messages
</li><li>	Revisability: A can revise message for B (before they’re sent, like Slack or text or email)
</li></ul>


<p><b>Media Equation Theory</b></p>
<p>	 How people treat computers vs how they treat other person</p>
<ul><li>		People often treat computer the way they treat other person.
</li></ul>
<p>	</p>
<p>Maners: How polite people are to the machine, interpersonal distance</p>
<p>Personality: They treat machine like if they have personality</p>
<p>Emotions:</p>
<p>Teammates: view computer as teammates</p>


<p><b>Grice’s Maxims for Politeness</b></p>
<p>Quality: Things said should be true;</p>
<p>Quantity: Should contribute no more and no less that what conversation demands;</p>
<p>Relevance: Should be clearly related to purpose of conversation</p>
<p>Clarity: Contribution to a conversation should not be obscure</p>
