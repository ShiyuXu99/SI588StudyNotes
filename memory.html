    <h2 id="Working Memory">Working Memory</h2>
    <p>Short-term memory - Temporary buffer for information, what they used to call working memory.</p>
    <p><b>Definition</b>: A temp buffer for information that’s currently in used.</p>
    
    
    <p><b>Central executive</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Control three different sub system
    </li><li>	decides where to focus attention, does not store information.	
    </li></ul>
    
    <p> <b>Visuospatial sketchpad</b></p>
    <ul><li>	temporary store for visual/spatial information
    <ul><li>		ex. When you look at a map (what that map looks like)							
    </li></ul>
    </li></ul>
    <p><b>Phonological loop</b></p>
    <ul><li>	temporary store for auditory and verbal information
    <ul><li>		Sound, music
    </li></ul>
    </li></ul>
    
    <p><b>Episodic Buffer</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Orders, sequences and events to communicate to long-term memory, this is why patterned things are easier to remember. 
    </li></ul>
    
    <h3 id="Characteristic of Working Memory">Characteristic of Working Memory</h3>
    <ul><li>	Capacity is very small. Around 4+- 1 things that we can remember, Age can affect this number
    </li><li>	Fades very fast
    <ul><li>		if we want to maintain this memory, we have to constant refresh, and keep items in WM 
    </li><li>		ex. A phone number to memorize, you will constantly repeat the number, know as <b>maintenance rehearsal</b> 
    </li></ul>
    </li></ul>
    
    <h3 id="Things affecting working memory">Things affecting working memory</h3>
    <ul><li>	Numbers of items need to remember
    <ul><li>		chunking can increase recall (ex. Separate things into three characters)
    </li></ul></li><li>	Similarity reduces recall
    </li><li>	Repetition can lead to false recall
    </li><li>	Interruption will decrease working memory
    </li></ul>
    
    
    <h2 id="Long-Term Memory">Long-Term Memory</h2>
    <ul><li>	Where we store all our memories.
    </li></ul>
    
    <h3 id="Procedure memory">Procedure memory</h3>
    <ul><li>	Memories that are hard to describe( riding a bike,  tie a shoe)
    </li></ul>
    
    <h3 id="Declarative Memory">Declarative Memory</h3>
    <p><b>Semantic</b> - Factual memory, such as meaning of words, thing you know about different topics</p>
    <p><b>Episodic Memory</b> - Memory of different events.</p>
    
    <p>Memory have “colors”, emotions are attached to the memories. </p>
    
    
    <h2 id="Learning">Learning</h2>
    <p>Moving working memory to long-term memory.</p>
    
    <p>Something learned previously can influence your ability to learn something new:				</p>
    <ul><li>	<b>Positive transfer</b>: Previous learning <u>HELPS</u> learn something new.	(ex. Drive a golf car help you drive a real car in the future)
    </li><li>	<b>Negative transfer</b>: Previous learning <u>INHIBITS</u> your ability to learn something new. 
    </li></ul>
    
    <h2 id="Long-term memory retrieval">Long-term memory retrieval</h2>
    <p><b>Recognition</b></p>
    <ul><li>	realizing that a stimulus matches a goal
    </li><li>	This is the <b>easier</b> method (like a multiple choice question)
    </li></ul>
    <p><b>Recall</b></p>
    <ul><li>	remembering the right option with no stimulus
    </li><li>	factors that can help you remember ( routines and memorization tricks, context and state are also factors)
    </li><li>	When in the same emotion, memory is easier to recall.
    </li></ul>
    
    <p>Proactive interference & Retroactive interference - old memory are replaced by the new one.</p>
    
    <p>Long term memory lose strength, so it’s harder to retrieve. </p>
    
    <h3 id="Factors affect retrieval of LTM (long term memory)">Factors affect retrieval of LTM (long term memory)</h3>
    <ul><li>	Strength of item in LTM
    <ul><li>		effect by <b>frequency</b> and <b>recency</b>
    </li></ul></li><li>	Numbers of association between item and other things
    </li></ul>
    
    <p><b>Habituation</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Built through <u>repetition</u> in a <u>consistent context</u> over time, with embedded rewards
    </li><li>	No repetition, no habit.
    </li><li>	No consistency, slower habit formation.
    </li></ul>
    
    
    <h2 id="Organization of Memory">Organization of Memory</h2>
    <p>Four types of organization</p>
    <p><b>Semantic networks</b></p>
    <ul><li>	How things are linked together
    </li></ul>
    <p><b>Schemas</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Mental concept that help organize concepts.
    </li><li>	ex. Dogs have tails, they are furry
    </li><li>	if something seems out of place, that’s because schemas are conflicting with 
    </li><li>	<b>Script</b> - special type of schema
    </li></ul>
    <p><b>Mental models</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Theories hold of how things works
    </li><li>	planning and trouble shooting
    </li></ul>
    <p><b>Cognitive maps</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Locations and spacial environment.
    </li><li>	ex. Thinking where the classroom are in a building, where the shopping cart is in an online website
    </li></ul>
    
    <h3 id="Modern view of Memory">Modern view of Memory</h3>
    <ul><li>	There is no physiological difference between WM and LTM
    </li><li>	Perception activates a neural pattern
    </li><li>	All memories are patterns of neural activity
    </li><li>	Attention can focus on only a few patterns at a time
    </li><li>	All observations from “classic” view still hold
    </li></ul>
    
    
    
    <h2 id="Implementation in Design">Implementation in Design</h2>
    <p>Designs needs to :</p>
    <ul><li>	Minimize working memory’s load
    </li><li>	Provide redundant visual echoes with sound info
    <ul><li>		Hold user hands and provide place holders through sequential tasks so they don’t lose their place
    </li></ul></li><li>	Exploit chunking (physical size, meaningful sequences, letters vs. numbers, and separation of letters and numbers)
    </li><li>	Minimize confusability
    </li><li>	Avoid unnecessary zeroes in codes
    </li><li>	Keep WM in mind when developing instructions
    <ul><li>		Ensure congruence
    </li></ul></li><li>	Avoid negative phrasing
    </li></ul>
    
    <p>Design systems to:</p>
    <ul><li>	Encourage regular use (increase frequency and recency)
    </li><li>	Encourage active verbalization reproduction of info
    </li><li>	Standardize
    </li><li>	Use memory aides
    </li><li>	Design info to be remembered
    </li><li>	Design helpful habits
    </li><li>	Support development of correct mental models
    </li></ul>
    
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul><li>	Shopping site memorize what you usually buy so you don’t have to remember daily things.
    </li><li>	Visual cues for modes and sequence (controller that can’t separate modes)
    </li></ul>
    
    <h3 id="Individual Differences">Individual Differences</h3>
    <p><b>What is usability?</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Designing the system to satisfy the needs of the user.
    </li><li>	Get to know the users are very important.
    </li></ul>
    <p><b>What is considered good design?</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Designs that can fit new user as well as experts (people who are familiar with computers learn things faster.
    </li></ul>
    <p><b>How can we design for everyone?</b></p>
    <ul><li>	Adopt accessible computing approaches to design. (Improve access, independence, quality of life for people with disabilities)
    </li></ul>
