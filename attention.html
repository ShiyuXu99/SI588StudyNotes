<h1 id="Attention">Attention</h1>
<p><span class='hashtag'>#SI588</span></p>

<p>We don’t perceive everything we encounter, so what are the things that we will pay attention to?</p>

<h3 id="Four Factors influence what we select to attend to:">Four Factors influence what we select to attend to:</h3>
<ul><li>	<b>Salience</b> - How much a stimuli stand out
</li><li>	<b>Expectancy</b> - We tend to look at things we expected to be there
</li><li>	<b>Value</b> - Pay-out to finding the stimuli we need. 
</li><li>	<b>Effort</b> - How difficult it is to find a stimuli.
</li></ul>

<p>Ex. Stop signs are red</p>


<h2 id="Attention Process">Attention Process</h2>
<h3 id="Three Perceptual Process">Three Perceptual Process</h3>
<p>  <b>Bottom-up Processing</b> </p>
<p>	physical makeup of stimulus, driven by salience;</p>

<p><b>Top-Down processing</b> </p>
<p>	Based on knowledge and contact, driven by <b>expectancy</b> and <b>value</b></p>

<p><b>Unitization</b> - Combined of the two process above</p>

<p>Example: </p>
<p>Image with words all messed up.</p>
<p>Top down processing help us guess what the content is, it’s driven by previous knowledge of words. It allows up understand things in different ways. </p>


<h2 id="Eye Movement: Visual Search">Eye Movement: Visual Search</h2>
<p>Two type of Movement</p>
<p><b>Pursuit</b> - Tracking a moving object. (Red dot across the screen)</p>
<p><b>Saccadic</b> - Abrupt motions from one spot to another. (Recognize who the person is from her face), it also help us determined what order people will use when scanning a website. </p>

<h3 id="Saccades">Saccades</h3>
<ul><li>	Initiation Latency -  Amount of time take to initiate a saccade
</li><li>	Movement Time - Time for move from one spot to the next
</li><li>	Destination - point of fixation (most of our time during eye movement)
<ul><li>		time/duration - how easily people can interpret the picture, extract things take more time
</li><li>		Useful field of view - people can grab lots of info on one glance
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Visual Search</b></p>
<p>Salience</p>
<p>Desirable when you want people to find the target.</p>

<p>Expectations</p>
<p>People already have expectations for where to find things (Like the log out button, or the place of Michigan in a drop-down menu)</p>

<p><b>Signal Detection Theory</b></p>
<p>There are two state - Target present/absent</p>

<h2 id="Discrimination & Absolute Judgement">Discrimination & Absolute Judgement</h2>
<p><b>Confusion</b> occurs when two stimuli are very similar to each others. </p>
<p><b>Absolute</b> refers to our ability to  judge the absolute value of a variable. People are often not good at it.</p>


<h2 id="Visual queries - Driving eye movements">Visual queries - Driving eye movements</h2>
<p>	We conduct visual queries in  multiple loops. Outer, middle and inner loop. ex. Outer will find fruit, middle will began to look for fruit, inner will distinguish if it is a fruit.</p>

<h3 id="Visual Design Tips">Visual Design Tips</h3>
<ul><li>	For <b>bottom-up</b> - Designs need to be clear and non ambiguous.
</li><li>	Should use things that people are already familiar to., <u>consistency</u> is the key. 
</li><li>	Understand the user and know what they want to look at (use expectations)
</li></ul>
