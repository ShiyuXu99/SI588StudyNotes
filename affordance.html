<p><span class='hashtag'>#SI588</span></p>

<p>Awareness of the meaning of dynamic changes in the </p>
<p>environment.</p>

<ul><li>	Perception (Perceive changes)
</li><li>	Understanding (What changes mean)
</li><li>	Projection/Prediction
</li></ul>


<p>Designing tasks & systems: tension between situation awareness and </p>
<p>performance</p>
<p>Situation awareness is not related to performance.</p>

<h3 id="Tips for Design a system to improve situation awareness:">Tips for Design a system to improve situation awareness:</h3>
<ul><li>	Help people notice changes. 
</li><li>	Make the situation easy to understand.
</li><li>	Keep the operator in the loop.
</li><li>	Help people project the future state of the system.
</li><li>	Organize information around goals.
</li><li>	Display to broaden attention. 
</li></ul>

<h3 id="Problem shooting & Trouble shooting">Problem shooting & Trouble shooting</h3>
<p>Problem Solving Approaches: Trial and error, luck, roubleshooting (requires mental model)</p>
<p>Trouble shooting is a part of problem solving.</p>

<h3 id="Both impose cognitive burdens.">Both impose cognitive burdens.</h3>

<p>How to evaluate?</p>
<p>Events VS Non events.</p>

<h3 id="Failures:">Failures:</h3>
<ul><li>	Cognitive tunneling – Occurs when you become fixated on one solution, even if it isn’t working.
</li><li>	Confirmation bias – Tendency to favor information that confirms beliefs or hypotheses. 
</li></ul>


<h3 id="Planning and Scheduling">Planning and Scheduling</h3>
<ul><li>	Future can be broken into predicted states vs. command  (desired) states. 
</li><li>	Mental simulation: running the mental model to determine  predicted state. 
</li><li>	People tend to avoid complex, long range planning.
</li><li>	Automation tools can aid in planning/scheduling
</li></ul>

<h3 id="Metacognition and Effort">Metacognition and Effort</h3>
<p>Metacognition: knowing what you know</p>
<p>Anticipated effort: weighing the cost/benefit of taking action</p>
<p>(It’s possible to be wrong on both)</p>

<h2 id="Don Norman: Good Design">Don Norman: Good Design</h2>
<p>Two characteristics of good design:</p>
<ul><li>	<b>Understanding</b>
</li><li>	<b>Discoverability</b>
<ul><li>		Affordances - A relationship between “the world and an actor”
<ul><li>			Not inherent to an object. 
</li><li>			There can also be anti-affordances. 
</li><li>			Affordances must be discoverable.
</li><li>			Affordances exist even if not visible.
</li></ul></li><li>		Signifiers - A signifier communicates to a user where an action should take place. 
<ul><li>			Deliberate
</li><li>			Accidental/unintentional
</li></ul></li><li>		Constraints
</li><li>		Mappings - The relationship between two things (controls their results in the world. 
</li><li>		Feedback - Feedback communication of a system to a user
</li></ul>
