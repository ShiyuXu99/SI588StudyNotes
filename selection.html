    <p>Example of input model and how we use it.</p>
    
    <h3 id="Tradeoffs">Tradeoffs</h3>
    <ul><li>	Speed – Accuracy
    </li><li>	Recognition – Recall (recall is slower)
    </li><li>	Ease – Stigma (bee. Bigger button)
    </li></ul>
    
    
    <h2 id="Fitts’s Law">Fitts’s Law</h2>
    <p>Fitts’s Law tells us that larger, closer targets are easier for us to hit when pointing.</p>
    <p>(The pointing time depending on the distance you are to the target and the size of the target)</p>
    <ul><li>	Fitts’s Law: T = a + b*ID
    <ul><li>		a = intercept concept constant - how easy to start and stop moving
    </li><li>		b = Slope constant - how hard it is to move and point
    </li></ul>
    </li></ul>
    
    <p><b>Larger objects  = faster pointing</b></p>
    <p><b>Shorter distances  =  faster reactions</b></p>
    
    
    <h2 id="Stimulus-Response Compatibility">Stimulus-Response Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Stimuli and responses are compatible when they are mapped in some meaningful way—e.g., they are the same color, their physical arrangements match. Well-mapped stimuli and responses mean slower selection times.</p>
    
    <p>	If Stimuli & Response are <i>mapped</i>, response time does <b>not</b>vary with number of options (n)</p>
    <p>	If S & R are <b>not</b> <i>mapped</i>, response time does vary with number of options (n)</p>
    
    <p>Example: Button of the burners that matched the burner’s placement.</p>
    
    
    <h2 id="Hick’s Law">Hick’s Law</h2>
    <p>Hick’s Law tells us that the time it takes to choose a response is a function of how many choices we have.</p>
    
    <p>Example: Amazon’s front page. Shouldn’t overwhelm user with too much choices on one page.</p>
    
    
    <h2 id="Design Implications">Design Implications</h2>
    <ul><li>	Broader and shallower menu are easier to choose.
    </li><li>	Selection time is depended on the size of the button (size of the target)
    </li><li>	Arrangement  (placing things on a corner is a bad idea)
    </li><li>	Sometimes by touch is faster by sight (like driving)
    </li></ul>
